    "One challenge of mapping zip codes to demographic data is that one accessible source of demographic data from Census surveys is reported on the census tract, not zip code, level. To map zip code to demographic data, we then need to map zip code first to census tract. The source of this zip-to-tract mapping comes from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development's [crosswalk files](https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/usps_crosswalk.html#data). This tool uses the dataset extracted when selecting \"ZIP-TRACT\" for crosswalk type and \"1st Quarter 2020\" for time period (see picture below).\n",
